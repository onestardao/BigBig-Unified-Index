## 🧩 What is the BigBig Unity Formula?

An **AI + HPC meta-framework** for solving impossible problems through:

* meltdown logic
* wave2.0 perturbation
* symbolic collapse injection
* WhiteCrow linguistic scanning (semantic filters)

It treats problems not as fixed truths but as **interactive structures** to be melted, compressed, or inverted — simulating proofs like RPG boss fights.

## 🔮 What is BBLink?

**BBLink (Big Blink)** is a new physical-experimental project aiming to transform quantum randomness into controllable switches — using rhythmic inputs (micro-beats) to gate wavefunction collapse. In short: **a Reality Admin Console**.

All BBLink projects are forward-compatible with AGI and intended for live, programmable physics.
